Installation:
	not yet supported. But you could just put it into your i3 config location

Usage:
	start the myoverview.py once. It will run in the background until killed.
	start the notifier.py to raise and hide the window (i have it binded to mod+y, thats how I intended to use it)
	
	If you want to set it fullscreen in your i3 config: for_window[class="i3-overview"] fullscreen enable
